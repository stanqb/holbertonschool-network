# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

This project explores the complete journey of a web request from your browser to Google's servers and back. It's designed to demonstrate understanding of web infrastructure, networking concepts, and the full stack architecture.

## Project Overview

When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events occurs behind the scenes. This project breaks down that process into its fundamental components and explains each step in detail.

## Topics Covered

- **DNS Request**: How domain names are resolved to IP addresses
- **TCP/IP**: The foundational protocols that enable internet communication
- **Firewall**: Security mechanisms that filter network traffic
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encryption protocols that secure web communications
- **Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution systems for scalability and reliability
- **Web Server**: The software that serves web content
- **Application Server**: The backend logic that processes requests
- **Database**: Data storage and retrieval systems

## Deliverables

1. **Blog Post** (`0-blog_post`): A comprehensive article explaining the entire process
2. **Diagram** (`1-what_happen_when_diagram`): A visual representation of the request flow

## Requirements

- Blog post must be published on a public platform (Medium, LinkedIn, etc.)
- All content must be written in English
- Diagram must illustrate all key components of the web request flow
- Both deliverables must include shareable URLs

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of:
- How the internet works at a fundamental level
- The role of each component in the web infrastructure stack
- Security considerations in web communications
- Scalability patterns in modern web applications
