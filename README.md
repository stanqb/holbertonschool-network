# Network Basics

This project covers fundamental concepts of computer networking, focusing on the OSI model, network types, protocols, and basic networking tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

### OSI Model
- What it is and its purpose
- The seven layers and how they're organized
- Practical applications of the model

### Network Types
- LAN (Local Area Network): usage and typical size
- WAN (Wide Area Network): usage and typical size
- Internet fundamentals

### IP Addressing
- IP address concept and function
- IPv4 vs IPv6 addressing
- Localhost and subnets

### TCP/UDP Protocols
- Differences between TCP and UDP
- Common ports (SSH: 22, HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443)
- When to use each protocol

### Networking Tools
- Network connectivity testing
- Port listening and analysis

## Project Requirements

- All Bash scripts must be executable and pass shellcheck
- Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Scripts must include a comment explaining their function
- Files should end with a new line
- Projects must include this README.md

## Tasks Overview

0. OSI model conceptual understanding
1. Network types identification
2. MAC and IP address concepts
3. TCP and UDP protocol comparison
4. Creating a script to display TCP/UDP listening ports
5. Creating a script to test network connectivity via ICMP

## Repository Structure
