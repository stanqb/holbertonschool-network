# Network Basics - Holberton School

This project focuses on basic network configuration and manipulation in Ubuntu. Through a series of bash scripts, we'll learn how to modify IP configurations, display active IP addresses, and set up a simple port listener.

## Tasks

* **0-change_your_home_IP**: Configures an Ubuntu server to resolve localhost to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com to 8.8.8.8
* **1-show_attached_IPs**: Displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine
* **2-port_listening_on_localhost**: Sets up a listener on port 98 of localhost

## Requirements

* All scripts must be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Scripts must pass Shellcheck version 0.7.0 without errors
* First line of scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* Second line: Comment explaining script functionality

## Note

These scripts demonstrate fundamental networking concepts including hosts file manipulation, IP address management, and basic socket communication.
